    # Normally rattler-build tries to modify the install_name of the binary as well as other load commands to make it relocatable.
    # This is not strictly required here, as the library has no dependencies outside of the sysroot.
    # The operation by rattler-build will still fail, as the library was pre-compiled without "-headerpad_max_install_names",
    # so replacing the install_name due to insufficient size.
